# Data Analyst Curriculum

Welcome to our Data Analyst Curriculum!

We have designed this course using data from real job descriptions for data analyst positions. We used natural language processing techniques to extract relevant skills, and then grouped them into clusters using various clustering algorithms.

The final curriculum is presented in a clear and visually appealing format using python libraries and Adobe Illustrator.
